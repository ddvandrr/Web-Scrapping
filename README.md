**Web Scrapping**
The workflow involved inspecting the HTML structure of the website to identify table elements, extracting relevant data such as rows and columns, and storing the information in a structured format like CSV or Excel for easy analysis. By focusing on data presented in tables, the scraper efficiently collected large volumes of information from pages without manual data entry.
